# Regression Analysis & Feature Selection (R)

## Project Overview
Statistical modeling project focused on identifying the most relevant explanatory variables and building interpretable regression models using real-world data.

## Objective
Explain the behavior of a target variable through a reduced set of decisive predictors while maintaining most of the model’s explanatory power.

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis and correlation assessment
- Multiple linear regression modeling
- Multicollinearity diagnostics
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to support feature selection
- Model evaluation focused on interpretability and robustness

## Results
- Identification of key explanatory variables
- Reduction of the final model to two–three decisive predictors
- Clear interpretation of variable effects and relationships

## Tools
- R
- Statistical modeling and visualization libraries

## Key Takeaways
- Simpler models can offer comparable explanatory power with better interpretability
- Feature selection is critical for decision-oriented modeling
- Statistical diagnostics are essential to ensure model reliability

## Notes
This project was developed as part of an academic statistics course and is presented as an example of applied statistical reasoning.
